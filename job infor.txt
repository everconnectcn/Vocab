Working as a senior software developer, I'm currently developing the Search feature for our APP, Junhong, which is used as mobile client to trade stocks by our customers. Formerly I developed and maintained the News and Analysis system, offering customers latest news and analysis information for each company. Upon arriving at this company, I set up an internal Maven repository for our Mobile Platform developing group, making collaboration and future DevOps process easier. I also set up an proxy server so that members in our group can easily get access to Google and other websites blocked in China.
