This diagram shows the process how the plastic bottles are recycled.

 The process begins with people throwing these bottles into recycling garbage bin,these bottles are then collected by a garbage truck and transported to the garbage center, at where they get sorted out by hand. In the next step, the bottles are then compressed into large blocks and then crushed into bits and pieces with a process called crushing. Those bits and pieces are then washed in liquid and then turned into blastic pellets using a large machine. The next step, the plastic pellets are heated to form raw material, then these raw material are transported to different facturies, these facturies will use the raw material to produce all kinds of end products such as bottles, handbags and clothes, which will then be bought by end consumers, thus close the circle of plastic bottles.
