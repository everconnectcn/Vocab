 Bonfire Night
British people celebrate Bonfire Night every year on 5 November in memory of a famous event in British history, the ↑Gunpowder Plot. On 5 November 1605 a group of ↑Roman Catholics planned to blow up the ↑Houses of Parliament while King ↑James I was inside. On the evening before, one of them, Guy Fawkes, was caught in the cellars with gunpowder (= an explosive), and the plot was discovered. He and all the other conspirators were put to death. Bonfire Night is sometimes called Guy Fawkes Night.
Originally, Bonfire Night was celebrated as a victory for ↑Protestants over Catholics, but the festival is now enjoyed by everyone. Some children make a guy, a figure of a man made of old clothes stuffed with newspaper or straw to represent Guy Fawkes. The guy is then burned on top of a bonfire on Bonfire Night. A few days before, children take their guy into the street and ask for a ‘penny for the guy’, money for fireworks (= small packets of explosives which, when lit, make a bang or send a shower of coloured light into the air). Only adults are legally allowed to buy fireworks.
Some people hold private bonfire parties in their gardens, while others attend larger public events organized by local councils or charities. Chestnuts or potatoes are often put in the bonfire so that they will cook as it burns. Fireworks such as Roman candles, Catherine wheels (AmE pinwheels), bangers and rockets are put in the ground and are let off one by one. Children hold lighted sparklers (= metal sticks covered in a hard chemical substance that burns brightly when lit) in their hands and wave them around to make patterns. Unfortunately, there are sometimes accidents involving fireworks and there are now restrictions on the type of fireworks that can be used by the general public.
The events of 5 November 1605 are celebrated in a nursery rhyme: Please to remember, The fifth of November, Gunpowder, treason and plot.
