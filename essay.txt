Dear Mr Smith
From the announcement you made last week, I know that we are looking for an superviscor for our workplace, Here I recommend myself as a condidate for this occupation.
Here are some of my advantages of doing this job, I've worked here 5 years and I am familiar with every product and procedures of our company, I have a graet relationship with everyone here which makes perfect for communicating and coordenating. 
Secondly I know every shortcoming of our workplace comparing to other industuries which is undercommunication because of physical limit, also some major malfunction could not be reported immediately because lack of enough telecommunicating equitment. Im planing to digitize our workplace so that eveyone can report realtime situation without any delay. Also I would work to make our work place like a family, for example, celebrating everyone's birthday by throwing a party and organize similar event every month.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.
luke
