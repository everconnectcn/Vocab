speaking 
No doubt the incident occurred on a hot summer day. I was finishing a landscaping project and ran out of some plastic material I was using. In order to be able to finish I had my helper continue and I made a mad dash into the town to buy some more of the items I needed.. I was wearing a very loose pair of cordarory shorts the waist band had been over stretched and I had to keep pulling them up. I never wear underware, I was sweating , had on a t shirt. I arrive at a dollar store and had a hard time locating the item or something I could use in its place. I was constantly pulling up my shorts when I see the items. I grabbed a armful and using both arms and hands to hold them I headed to the checkout counter. I’m feeling my shorts start to go south. I did what every guy does in this situation and spread my legs when walking to keep them in place at least until I made it to the counter. I almost made it, my shorts feel to my ankles about 6 feet from the counter. No other customer was at the counter so I stepped out of my shorts and dropped all the items I had in my arms on the conveyor belt. At this point I’m naked from the waist down except for sneakers. The cashier had a smile on her face and as I turned around to retrieve my shorts on the floor When I see about 4 or 5 people staring at me both men and women. I acted like this is a normal thing, walked over picked up the shorts put them on and returned to the counter, paid and left. Not a word was said by anyone.
