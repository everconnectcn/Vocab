The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females who  completed 
various educational qualifications in NZ in 2005.  
Nearly 90% of people who completed trade certificates were male compared to 
a figure of around 10% for females. The reason for this difference is likely to be 
that skilled trade certificate  courses comprise mainly male dominated trades 
such as plumbing, brick laying and carpentry. 
In contrast, diplomas and bachelor’s degrees are more female dominated with 
62%  and 55% of people  completing these qualifications  being female. The 
figures for males are  less  than 50% (38% and 45%, respectively). This reflects 
the fact that many females prefer to work in an office environment performing 
administration or professional based tasks.  
For higher qualifications (postgraduate diplomas and master’s or PhD degrees), 
there are a higher proportion of males (62% and 74%) compared to females (38% 
and 26%) who completed these degrees. This difference is most likely to be due 
to  the preference of females to focus on families at the expense of higher 
education.
