I have always been amazed by computers and programs about how they show us vivid graphics and allow users to create things, even though I had little experience growing up in rural China in the 90s. I learned Office Suite in my middle school computer class and Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Flash by myself, but I didn't know much about the internet until I graduate from high school and started to apply for colleges.
I start my first programming course (c language) in my second semester of college, even though the textbooks and IDEs we used are outdated and what we do mostly happened on the command line, it greatly intrigued me. Then I wanted to create a graphic interface. Then I learned Java by myself.
Back when I was still in college, Google is not entirely blocked in mainland China, I was lucky to have the opportunity to search for high-quality tutorials and learn from them. Since China's Internet censorship has become stricter, it became harder and harder to visit "foreign" websites. I  used different ways to try to bypass the GFW. I set up a v2ray server on overseas VPS.  and shared it with my coworkers so that we can use Google, GitHub, StackOverflow, and other websites to facilitate our developing process and learn new things.
In retrospect, there are so many obstacles in the way of people learning new skills. While there is a boom during the last decade in the smartphone industry and there are many APPs entertaining people, there are few that people can learn new skills and become more productive. As a programmer, I taught myself the programming of Java and Python. Yet still, there are numerous people who can't get access to the Internet, textbooks, and high-quality tutorials to acquire new skills. While my strength is backend programming, I know basic frontend programming and can design simple UI for websites. I wanted to learn more about Software Design and consolidate my skills and I want to be an entrepreneur and help more people to learn English, learn new skills, etc.
