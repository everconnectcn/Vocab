Ok actually I have seen a lot of film a lot of TV advertisement during my whole life 
and there are some kind of advertisement that they're really annoying 
but they do have some kind of effect because people can remember them 
there are also those kind of advertisements that they are really 
creative and inspirational they want people to go out and do some 
kind of sports and today I just wanted to discuss a advertisement that 
I really like and really get me into doing something and this 
advertisement is from Apple I think it's the one or the most valuable 
company in our world in our world so this ad is about its newest 
product airpod so this is the kind are actually this is kind of a 
earphone but it's wireless so when they are promoting this product 
they really put some sports element into it so I really love it actually 
I've been longing for a wireless earphone for a really long time and I 
just really into sports and
sometimes I go for a jog and sometimes go for cycling alongside the river, and really when I'm using 
my old earphone I have to you know deal with the hassle of being 
sometimes it entangles with my bicycle, with my clothes, so I really 
think it's so annoying and this one I really after some kind of 
determination I bought it 

OK Actually in time China is such a vast country
 so actually there are a lot of tourist spots where people go often
 to you know just to relax and I think today I wanna to talk about some someplace that I really like and it's about I Shanghai and it's actually super super famous 
for the local people and for other other tourists from from outside to 
the city and and what the most important part is that it's free and people ca enjoy the skyline and the and the Ray Rice quite a scenic spot and actually I have been there for so many times and I returned when I friend come to visit me I will bring them to bring them with me to to to this place just to like people watching and 
sometimes go for a walk and you know sometimes even when I was alone 
I go to those this spot and  sometimes I really I'm really into cycling so 
there's a designate cycling route where you know the the trees are 
arching over the path and it's really a unique experience and actually 
like 20 years ago this place used to be such in a wild state so after 
20 years 

okay actually there are a lot of famous people even when I was a child I know lot of famous people like the most richest people the like famous actors, actresses, and actually I have one role model when I was a really young  and this person is called Bill Gates and they used to be one of the richest person in the world and today he's still one of the richest person and the reason why he's my role model is that a very inspires people it's really a smart one and since his high school he like created some stuffs, those programs to sell for living and later on he created this company called Microsoft and then lead it and guide it and then you know it's not about this it's not about how smart he is that inspired me but it's also about his entrepreneurship that you know inspired lots of people in our world to to create their 
own companies and to provide for people and since then like I think 
since his era or our world has started to change to the information age an I think maybe one day I want to become him and start my own company and you know not only to become a rich but also to provide something usefull to the people that I love and also, but there are some kind of scandals that related to him.

OK, actually during my life I have seen, I have watched, I will read so much magazines and some of them are about famous people, some of them are about movies and  
some of them are about like how to raise your own animals and today I wanted to talk about a magazine called time and it's about all the famous people that are influencing all the world 
and the reason 1ove this magazine is it's not only about news you know those newspapers they only focus on the current events but not really the past ones but this magazine they really offers me a some kind of insight into those people's lives and even ones that in the past happened in past so I don't really know who owns this 
magazine or who published it but I I bet it's be a it'll be a American 
company located in some kind of somewhere in New York so actually 
this magazine the reason why I love it is not only because it's content 
but also about its format. because I can download it free from the internet the digital copy I think it can circulate all over the world and 
maybe someday I want to start my own magazine because you know 
today always in the information age, everyone can start their own blog 
and maybe make a collection of their own life and you know make them free for everyone 

okay actually I'm not really a museum goer 
nor I'm really into art. so actually there are quite a limited number of museums or art galleries that I went to. so this time I want to talk a museum that is located in Shanghai so it's really near where I'm living 
so I love this museum and I actually went there once because you 
know it's kind of th landmark of Shanghai and so I went there just to 
check it and  actually I don't really remember anything from there I think there's one picture from the ancient China and there's still super super long and I think it's the one or the longest picture I have seen in my whole life and actually I think this museum is famous not only because of its content but also because it's architecture because it's so unique the architecture and the people I think people 
around the world will recognize it once they spotted it so sometimes I 
will go along the riverside and sometimes like cycling my bicycle 
along the Riverside and it's just located near there so I will take my 
take a lot of selfies with this museum and upload it into my Instagram 
and instantly I will get the lot of  thumbs up so 

actually I think I have competed in so many like things or whether it's exams or other kind of competitions and today off the top of my head the most of 
important one of course is a colleague entrance exam and I think it's the most important  moment of every Chinese people because it is 
essentially decided everyone's future and just this exam happened 
about 10 years ago and actually when I was a little young I was still a 
adolescent and but I know the importance of this exam and I have so 
many more exams in So I thought maybe yeah I will I will like I will 
pass the exam with flying colors because those mark exams before 
gave me so much confidence but that time when I really took it I can't 
really focus on the exam because you know the the mass exam is so much harder than I took the the other times so it's really floor me 
and I really don't know what to expect so even after exam I couldn't 
really face the reality so in the future when I had my when I have my 
own child I wouldn't want him to
