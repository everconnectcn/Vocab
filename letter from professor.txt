To Whom It May Concern,

Zhang Wang worked under my supervision during the years from 2013 to 2016. Throughout those years, Zhang had shown enormous enthusiasm in programming and especially in algorithms, his dissertation related to scheduling algorithm of SSD controller had well demonstrated it.  Zhang had also left a good impression with practical programming skills(for example, a command-line tool to test hard drive writing speed customized to meet lab needs), circuit designing skills, and the ability to use tools such as MATLAB&Simulink, Altium Designer, etc. Zhang had also shown remarkable abilities to read and categorize numerous English technical documents.

Zhang is also a person with a warm personality. He had demonstrated great kindness toward peers, great respect to teachers and infinite patience with work and research. There was quite a number of laborious and tedious work such as sorting out different electronic components mixed together by error and errand work such as buying a variety of components and sending them to our manufactures during that time, Zhang had done them in a meticulous manner and with great patience. Also, He had shown great respect and professionalism dealing with workers from our manufacturers, suppliers and other partners. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend that Zhang Wang could pursue his goal in this program. Zhang had shown great performance under my supervision, and he is an outstanding person both in personality and profession. I'm certain he will continue to work hard and do well in the future.
