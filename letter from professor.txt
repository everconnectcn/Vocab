To Whom It May Concern,

Zhang Wang worked under my supervision during the years from 2014 to 2016. Throughout these years, Zhang had demonstrated great kindness toward others, great respect to teachers and painstaking attention to work and research. There was quite a number of laborious work and errand work during that time, Zhang had done them in a meticulous manner. Also, Zhang had shown great professionalism dealing with suppliers and other partners.
As for research work, Zhang had shown great interest in how things work and especially enthusiasm with the algorithm, his essay related to this has demonstrated it. Zhang had shown great ability reading English documents and is capable of dealing with numerous English documents. Also, it had shown that Zhang is skilled using professional tools such as MATLAB&Simulink, Altium Designer and Office Suite, 

In conclusion, I highly recommend Zhang Wang to pursue his goal in this program. Zhang had shown great performance under my supervision, and I'm sure he will continue to work hard in the future. Feel free to contact me by email at sss@nwpu@edu.cn if you need any additional information.
