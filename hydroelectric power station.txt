The diagram shows how electricity is generated in a hydroelectric power station.
A river is divided into two parts by a dam(which blocks the water from flowing down) and a power station(which mainly serves the purpose of generating electricity and controlling the flow of water) into a high-level reservoir and a low-level reservoir, which are connected by water pipes.
At the high-level reservoir part, an intake at the bottom of the dam was connected to water pipes. During the day when electricity is highly demanded, water flows from a high-level reservoir through the intake and water pipes, driving the reversible turbines, and then flows into the low-level reservoir. The reversible turbines are attached to a generator by which electricity is generated. Electricity is then transmitted to the national grid by power lines.
During the night when there is excess electricity power, the above process is reversed. Water is pumped by reversible turbines from the low-level reservoir into a high-level reservoir so that the water can be reused the next day.
