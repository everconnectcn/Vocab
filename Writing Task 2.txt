Children appear to enjoy playing video games, and while there are undoubted benefits,
various negative effects stem from this too. Let us consider the main issues, and then outline possible
remedies.
Perhaps the major physical problem is the sedentary lifestyle which these games encourage,
meaning that youngsters may incline to obesity or inadequate development. Added to this is the
strain on eyesight resulting from excessive use of screens and consoles, meaning that children may
suffer symptoms of poor vision. There are also concerns about impairment of reflexes due to the
repetitive nature of the hand muscles when playing these games, and about the poor diet of
convenience food which often accompanies this lifestyle.
The most alarming psychological impact of such activities is possibly the risk of addiction,
meaning that children become obsessed with the games and are unable to socialise with family or
peers. This undermines their interpersonal skills and makes them underperform both academically
and socially.
