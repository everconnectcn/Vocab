morning routine
Cause I'm a night owl, I stayed up too late basically every night, it leaves not so much time to sleep well cause I have to go to work the next day. So usually I set up my alarm so late that it leaves me only 10 minutes to go to work. I spring off the bed, throw on my clothes, do everything in a hurry, and rush to my work.
