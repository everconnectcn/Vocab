Dear Professor Michael D. Adams,

My name is Wang Zhang, and I am applying for the M.Eng. program of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am currently working as a software engineer. And my work mainly involves back-end development such as a search system based on Elasticsearch and a canary roll-out system using Spring Boot. Attached are my CV, statement of results, sample of source code, IELTS score report.

I do not need financial support since I have worked for years and can cover for myself, I am applying for the January entry, but since there is not much time left to the application deadline, I am also interested in the may entry.

I am very interested in software security and object-oriented software development. My goal is to consolidate my practical knowledge and skills in software security, software scalability and software quality control. I have reviewed you and your staff profile and am interested in the work that you have done. I would like to get involved in the development of validation and verification of software systems because it will help me to better prepare for my career and goals.

Would you like to be the supervisor of my MEng program?

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Wang Zhang
