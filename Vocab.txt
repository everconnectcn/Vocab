 recreation and sport
      form of recreation and sport, popular among youths, in which a person rides standing balanced on a small board mounted on wheels. Considered one of the so-called extreme sports, skateboarding as a professional sport boasts a range of competitions, including vertical and street-style events. Vertical skating (also called “vert”) features aerial acrobatics performed in half-pipes that were originally built to emulate empty swimming pools. Street style features tricks performed in a real or simulated urban environment with stairs, rails, ledges, and other obstacles. Skateboarding has developed as a youth subculture that emphasizes creativity and individuality. It is an alternative to mainstream team sports, which are more formally organized and largely controlled by adults.
 
      The first commercial skateboards appeared in 1959, but crude homemade versions of skateboards, often consisting of nothing more than old roller-skate wheels attached to a board, were first built after the turn of the 20th century. In the early 1960s, skateboard manufacturers such as Makaha and Hobie attempted to capitalize on the rising popularity of surfing by promoting skateboarding, then known as “sidewalk surfing,” as an alternative diversion when no rideable waves were available. In 1963 Makaha formed the first professional skateboard team, and that same year the first skateboard competition was held in Hermosa, California. It included events in freestyle and downhill slalom skateboarding. The initial popularity of skateboarding waned over the next couple of years because of the limitations of the skateboard's maneuverability and because of warnings from safety professionals that the activity was dangerous.
 
      Skateboards were revived in the mid-1970s after the development of the faster and more-maneuverable polyurethane wheel and the introduction of the kicktail, the raised back end of the board that makes kickturns possible. The craze spread worldwide, and skateboard magazines helped promote both the sport and young innovative riders such as Tony Alva and Stacey Peralta. The first skate park was built in Florida in 1976, and many others began to appear throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia, all providing a variety of slopes and banked surfaces for sudden turns and stunts. It was at this time that riders started skating in empty pools and exploring the “vertical” potential of the sport. The empty pools soon gave way to half-pipes, U-shaped riding surfaces used to perform aerial stunts. Though protective gear such as helmets and knee pads was commonplace, safety concerns and escalating insurance premiums for skate parks played a major role in the sport's second fall from widespread popularity.
 
      In the 1980s skateboarding enjoyed an underground following. Skateboarders built their own ramps and half-pipes and began skating the urban environments, creating what became known as street style. Increased board size and improved truck constructions helped the new style thrive. It was during this time that a distinctive youth subculture began to develop around the sport. Punk rock (punk) and baggy clothes became closely associated with young skaters. The daring and individualistic nature of street and vert skateboarding was spread through straight-to-video documentary films that found a large youth audience. The videos made stars of vert skaters Tony Hawk (Hawk, Tony) and Steve Caballero and street skaters Natas Kaupas and Mark Gonzalez, among many others. But it was the advent of large competitions, such as the X Games, an alternative sports festival sponsored by the cable television network ESPN and first held in 1995, that gave the sport mainstream exposure and a certain commercial legitimacy. Skateboarding has established itself as a professional sport while still maintaining its independence from traditional team sports. snowboarding and in-line roller-skating have been heavily influenced by skateboarding techniques and culture.
 
      Most skateboards are about 32 inches (81 cm) long and 9 inches (23 cm) wide. A skateboard comprises three major parts: the deck (the board upon which the rider stands), the trucks (the construction that attaches the wheels to the deck), and the wheels. Originally, decks were made of wood, but later they were also made of aluminum, fibreglass, and plastic. The rear part of the deck is bent upward to form the kicktail, as is the front (“nose”) on modern designs. The truck includes an axle, a hangar (which houses the axle), and a cushion that both absorbs shocks and provides flexibility for steering. The wheels are made of tough polyurethane plastic.
 
      There are variations of the skateboard, most notably the longboard, which can run from 38 to 60 inches (96.5 to 152.5 cm) in length. The sport of street luge began with the use of longboards, ridden in a prone position down a steep hill. The street luge vehicles are still essentially skateboards but are up to 8.5 feet (2.6 metres) long and have supports for the head and feet. They can reach speeds of 80 miles (130 km) per hour. Other modifications to the skateboard include sails for wind-aided riding and blades for skating on ice.
 
      Much of the excitement of skateboarding rests in the riders' creativity. Skaters compete to invent new tricks or new combinations of tricks. Three of the most fundamental skateboarding moves are the kickturn, the ollie, and the grind. A kickturn is accomplished when the rider pushes down on the kicktail, lifting the front wheels off the ground and spinning on the rear wheels. The hands-free aerial known as the ollie is one of the most important tricks in contemporary skateboarding. It was invented in 1978 by Alan (“Ollie”) Gelfand, who discovered that slamming his foot down on the kicktail and simultaneously sliding his front foot forward caused the board and himself to jump into the air together. A grind involves riding with the trucks against the edge or top of an object.
 
      World Cup Skateboarding, founded in 1994, oversees the biggest street and vert skateboarding competitions, including events in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States and throughout Europe and Asia.

Culture:
student life [hall of residence student life]
The popular image of student life is of young people with few responsibilities enjoying themselves and doing very little work. This is often not true. Many older people now study at college or university, sometimes on a part-time basis while having a job and looking after a family. Many students are highly motivated and work very hard.
In Britain reduced government support for higher educationmeans that students can no longer rely on having their expenses paid for them. Formerly, students received a grant towards their living expenses. Now most can only get a loan, which has to be paid back. From 1999 they have had to pay a fixed amount towards tuition fees and from 2006 universities will be able to increase the amount up to a maximum of £3 000 per year. In the US students already have to pay for tuition and room and board. Many get a financial aid package which may include grants, scholarships and loans. The fear of having large debts places considerable pressure on students and many take part-time jobs during the term and work full-time in the vacations.
Many students in Britain go to a university away from their home town. They usually live in a hall of residence for their first year, and then move into a rented room in a private house or share a house with housemates. They may go back home during vacations, but after they graduate most leave home for good. In the US too, many students attend colleges some distance from where their parents live. They may live on campus in one of the halls, or off campus in apartments and houses which they share with room-mates. Some students, especially at larger universities, join a ↑fraternity or ↑sorority, a social group usually with its own house near the campus. Fraternities and sororities often have names which are combinations of two or three letters of the Greek alphabet. Some people do not have a good opinion of them because they think that students who are members spend too much time having parties.
In Britain the interests of students are represented by a student’s union which liaises with the university on academic matters, arranges social events and provides advice to students. Individual unions are affiliated with (= linked to) the ↑NUS. The student union building is usually the centre of student life and has a bar and common room, and often a restaurant and shops. British universities have a wide range of societies, clubs and social activities including sports, drama and politics. One of the highlights (= main events) of the year is rag week, a week of parties and fund-raising activities in support of various charities.
Especially in their first year, US students spend a lot of time on social activities. One of the most important celebrations, especially at universities which place a lot of emphasis on sports, is ↑homecoming. Many alumni (= former students) return to their alma mater (= college) for a weekend in the autumn to watch a ↑football game. During homecoming weekend there are also parties and dances, and usually a parade.
When social activities take up too much time, students skip lectures (= miss them) or cut class (AmE) and take incompletes (AmE), which means they have to finish their work after the vacation. In the US this has the effect of lowering their course grades, but most US universities expect this behaviour from students and do little to stop it. Students are thought to be old enough to make their own decisions about how hard they work and to accept the consequences. A few students drop out (AmE flunk out) but the majority try hard to get good grades and a good degree.

 Culture:
humour
A sense of humour (AmE humor), an ability to see the funny side of life, is considered essential by most British and American people. Everyone needs to be able to laugh at themselves sometimes, and to recognize that the situation they are in may look funny to others. It is considered a serious criticism of somebody to say that they have no sense of humour.
Some people have a dry sense of humour, and can keep a straight face (= not smile) and let their voice sound as though they are being serious when they are joking. Other people are said to be witty (= show a very clever type of humour). A person’s sense of humour is influenced by many things, including family and social background and age.
British and American humour on stage have some important differences, although the fact that some comedy television programmes are popular in both countries shows that there is some common ground. American sitcoms (= shows in which the humour comes from situations that the characters get into) such as ↑Frasier, ↑Friends and ↑Seinfeld are as popular in Britain as Britain’s own ↑Vicar of Dibley and ↑Office. Sitcoms often have a laugh track (= a recording of people laughing) so that the audience at home will laugh in the right places. In many sitcoms gentle fun is made of ordinary life without the risk of causing anyone serious offence.
American stage humour is more direct than British comedy. In the American series Cheers, for instance, the humour comes from characters like Coach and Woody being more stupid than any real person could possibly be. But in the British comedy ↑Fawlty Towers Basil Fawlty’s funny characteristics are exaggerated versions of those found in the type of Englishman he represents. Slapstick comedy, which is based on people falling over, bumping into each other, etc. is now less popular in Britain.
British comedy makes frequent use of irony, humour which depends on a writer or performer suggesting the opposite of what is actually expressed. Many novels, films, stage plays, etc. use irony, even when discussing serious subjects such as death. Popular humour may sometimes rely on double entendre (= using a phrase that can be understood in two ways, one of which is usually sexual) or on innuendo (= making an indirect suggestion of something rude). These were both used a lot in the popular series of Carry On films that began in the 1960s.
Satire (= making people or institutions appear ridiculous to show how foolish or bad they are) is an important element of popular British political comedy programmes such as ↑Yes, Minister and Spitting Image. One of the most successful British comedy series, which also became popular in the US, was ↑Monty Python's Flying Circus. It had a zany (= odd and silly) and satirical humour which appealed especially to young people.
Comic strips and cartoons, whether printed in newspapers, shown on television or the Internet or made into films, are popular in both the US and Britain. The most famous include ↑Peanuts, ↑Tom and Jerry and ↑Simpsons.
Stand-up comedians like Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld in the US and in Britain Peter Kay, Eddie Izzard and Jo Brand, perform on television or in clubs, telling gags (= jokes) and funny stories which end with a punch line, the part where the audience is supposed to laugh. Many comedians tell jokes that are funny because of some racial or sexual innuendo, and this may be considered unacceptable for family audiences. In Britain, common targets of comedians include mothers-in-law, foreigners and people from particular parts of Britain, especially Scotsmen (who are supposed to hate spending money) and Irishmen (who are supposed to be stupid). Many people find such jokes offensive, and the new generation of comedians has avoided making fun of people’s race. Another form of comedy is for people from minority groups to make fun of their own customs and attitudes.
Many people tell jokes at school, at home and at the office. People may start a speech with a joke or funny story to help break the ice (= make people feel more relaxed).
Children tell jokes that involve a play on words, such as ↑knock-knock jokes or ‘What do you call...’ jokes e.g. ‘What do you call a man with a seagull on his head?’ ‘Cliff’.
Adults sometimes tell what in the US are called Polish jokes because they are about a particular national or racial group. There are also jokes about blondes (= women with fair hair) being stupid, and lawyers having bad characters. For instance, ‘Why do they do lab experiments on lawyers?’ ‘Because there are some things that even a rat won’t do.’ On the whole this type of humour is considered dated and in bad taste. Light bulb jokes make fun of the worst characteristic of any group of people, by suggesting mistakes they would make in trying to change a light bulb: ‘How many psychologists does it take to change a light bulb?’ - ‘Just one, but it has to really want to change.’
Practical jokes involve tricking people, and are not usually very popular, but on ↑April Fool's Day (1 April) people traditionally play practical jokes on each other. Newspapers often include a story that is not true hoping that some readers will believe it and then feel silly.

In time The Simpsons would, indeed, resort to spoofing such decidedly non-spooktacular fare like E.T and Mr. And Mrs. Smith (both in “Treehouse Of Horror XVIII”) but in 1992 the field was wide-open and the show could cherry-pick the most iconic and beloved fright fare of all time.

From all the available statistics, the politician cherry-picked only those that backed up his ideas.
1999, Nicholas Alexander and Gary Akehurst, The Emergence of Modern Retailing, 1750-1950, p.38:
The reason for this concentration is to attempt to alleviate the problems of fragmentation which usually accompany the study of retailing, particularly at the end of the early period, and has so often happened in the past, to curtail the temptation to 'cherry-pick' the best evidence from a wide, but not necessarily related, area.
2001, Ian St. John in sci.environment
You are *asking* for a specific *subset* of the data to *prove* a specific theory. That is 'cherry picking'. It is no more valid to 'cherry pick' data to disprove global warming than it is to 'cherry pick' data to prove it. That is *science*. You *must* deal with the entire data set. What part of this is not clear?
2006, Scientific developments relating to the Abortion Act 1967: twelfth report of session 2006-07, Vol. 2: Oral and written evidence, p.32:
Yes, I do think in principle is is a good idea to have clearing houses where data is assessed and has as objective an account as possible given of the data because of the tendency of all organisations to cherry-pick those studies which may support a pre-existing position.
2008, Warren Davies, How to Study Psychology, p.80:
So it's possible to 'cherry pick' only the evidence that supports a position and ignore the rest. To the reader who does not know about the rest of the evidence, it may seem like a strong case. The whole body of evidence must be considered.

 stately homes
In Britain there are many large stately homes that belong or used to belong to upper-class aristocratic families. The houses are called stately homes from the opening lines of a poem by Felicia Hemans (1793–1835). They are sometimes also called country houses because most of them are in the countryside. Some are approached through large iron gates down a long drive. Many have formal gardens and are surrounded by a large private park, often with a lake.
Stately homes range from small manor houses to palaces. Manor houses date from the 14th century and are often square stone buildings with a central courtyard, and some are entered by crossing a moat which was originally a means of defence. Some larger houses were built in the 16th century, including ↑Hampton Court in south-west London, ↑Burghley House near Peterborough and Hardwick Hall near Derby.
Many stately homes date from the 18th century, and are associated with famous architects. ↑Blenheim Palace near Oxford was designed in the ↑baroque style by Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor. Holkham Hall in Norfolk, designed only a few years later by William ↑Kent, is in the Palladian style. Kedleston Hall near Derby, the home of the Curzon family, was mainly the work of Robert ↑Adam. The large estates attached to stately homes attracted ↑landscape gardeners such as ‘Capability’ Brown, who laid out the gardens at Burghley, Blenheim and ↑Chatsworth.
Stately homes are very expensive to look after and, in order to get enough money to do this, some owners open their houses to the public. They charge visitors an admission fee. Many stately homes have been given by their owners to the ↑National Trust, an organization which raises the money to look after them from gifts, membership fees and admission charges. In many cases, the former owners continue to live in part of the house. This arrangement means that the house is well cared for, and the family does not have to pay ↑inheritance tax when the owner dies.
Visitors go to stately homes to admire their architecture, and to walk round the gardens. They also go to see valuable furniture, paintings, tapestries and china that have been collected over a long period. Sometimes, documents about the family or about historical events are also displayed. There is generally a cafe and a shop selling souvenirs. During the summer, concerts or plays may be performed in the house or gardens. Some owners have added other attractions: at ↑Longleat House, for example, there is a safari park. The stately homes of England How beautiful they stand! Amidst their tall ancestral trees, O’er all the pleasant land. The stately homes of England How beautiful they stand! To prove the upper classes Have still the upper hand. the first verse of Felicia Hemans’ poem followed by Noel Coward’s 1938 version

kebab

 / kI5bAb; kE`bAb/ n (often pl 常作复数) small pieces of meat and vegetables cooked and (often) served on a skewer 烤肉串: lamb kebabs 烤羊肉串 * shish kebab 烤肉串.

Kebabs are various cooked meat dishes, with their origins in Middle Eastern cuisine. Numerous variants are popular around the world.
In many parts of Asia, the Muslim world, and in Indian English[1][2] and the languages of the Middle East, a kebab is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese chuan. In most English-speaking countries, a kebab is commonly the classic shish kebab or shashlik – small cubes of meat cooked on a skewer[3][4] – or, outside of North America where it is better known as gyros,[5] the more recent and now-ubiquitous fast-food doner kebab.[4][6]
Kebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables, and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are baked in a pan in an oven or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab.[3][7] The traditional meat for kebabs is most often mutton or lamb, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or more rarely due to religious prohibitions, pork.
