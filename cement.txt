The left diagram shows the procedures and equitments used  to produce cement where various machinery are involved and the main source being limestone and clay, and the right diagram shows how cement is used in the production of concrete which is used as a main source of building material.

In the production stage of cement, first the limestone and clay are mixed together and crushed to power in a crusher. The power are then mixed further in a mixer to make sure they are fully mixed together. The mixture is then heated in a retating heater to a certain degree and then grinded to more refined power which is the cement people use. At the last stage, the cement are packaged into bags.

In the production of concrete, four different materials are mixed together using a concrete mixer in a certain proportion(15% cement, 10% water, 25% sand and 50% gravel). Then the well mixed concrete are ready to be used in construction site.
