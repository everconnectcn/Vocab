entertainment industruy are surely a big part of our moern socity and serves a great deal to our daily life and oftern have an huge influence on our sotiety. it is argued that whether entertainers are paied too much and whether they have a positive effect on the socitty as a whole. this essay will disscuss whether tehy make a positive impact on our society and do they deserve the money being paid to them, and further give my opinion.
it is undeiyable that some top performers are being paid emonersly and some of them arening acting as a role modle to the socitry. Famojus singers such as justin ber are talented and have a huge fan base, and make the money taht other would not imagine, but they are acting as a bad example as a human being, some rape their fans and organize sex orgy and hurt or other bad demonior, so actually they doent deserve the trust and the public and the money that they earn.
On the other hand, there are a lot of good example of enterteainers doing good donating to nobal cause and try to do contrubate to the great good.also they raise aeareness to global warming ,human trafficing and other akin issues to the public and  some works dedecataly and 
as for the money tehy earn, it is not everyone can eran, it si because tehy work so hard at their job

it is not this perforesion as a job that make peole bad, is it those people that are in the indusctury,
