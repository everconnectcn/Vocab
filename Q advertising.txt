Question:
In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasise that their products are new in some way.
Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?


My answer:

In the business world, companies tend to emphasize the novel side of their products in order to be more appealing to customers and have stronger sales. While underlining the novelty can be a smart strategy to gain more potential buyers, it might also have some side effects. In this essay, the reason behind this approach, emphasizing novelty, will be discussed and we will give opinions on whether it is a positive or negative development.

Businesses advertise their product by emphasizing the novelty mainly to gain more customers because customers are always looking for something worth their hard-earned money. Take Apple for example, When each generation has some ground-breaking features that can address consumers' needs, people will flock to buy it. On the opposite, if it is just a normal product without appealing new features, people usually hesitate to buy it. Another reason is that it will show that the company is focusing on innovation, creating a positive public image of the company, which itself is a smart PR move, and if it does address the problem that bothers consumers, may create more brand loyalty.

But if this strategy is used incorrectly, it might have some reverse effect. For example, some companies try to scam their consumers by falsely claiming what their product can do, which may trick consumers into buying it for the short term. but eventually will be found by consumers and lose trust. another negative effect is that it might incentivize companies to put more effort into the advertising rather than the product itself, it is common for a product to have a nitch function that is unrelated to its original function, for example, a fridge that can be used as an mp3 player, which focuses on novelty rather than the functionality.

In summary, businesses buy to put more emphasis on the variety of their product in their advertisement mainly to have more consumers, this does have a positive effect if the product and the new feature benefit the consumers, else it is just a waste of resources.
