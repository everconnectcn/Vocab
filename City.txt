Word Origin:
Old English crūdan ‘press, hasten’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch kruien ‘push in a wheelbarrow’. In Middle English the senses ‘move by pushing’ and ‘push one's way’ arose, leading to the sense ‘congregate’, and hence (mid 16th cent.) to the noun.

Recommended reason: As a landmark of Shanghai, the Oriental Pearl has always been the only choice for foreign tourists to visit Shanghai. And for the locals who live in Shanghai all year round, on the weekends after a busy week, going out for a bike ride, looking up at the tall Oriental Pearl on the neck, and looking at the Bund is also a good way to relax.

Attractions along the way:

1. Lujiazui: Lujiazui is one of the most influential financial centers in China. It is located along the Huangpu River in Pudong New District, facing the Bund across the river. As one of the national strategic financial centers (Jiangbeizu and Lujiazui) of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, Lujiazui is the seat of the Greater China and East Asia headquarters of many multinational banks.

Located on the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai is among the world’s most populous cities. It is also a major financial center and transport hub that has undergone significant redevelopment since the 1990s. It is enowned for its Lujiazui skyline, and museums and historic buildings, such as those along The Bund, as well as the City God Temple and the Yu Garden.

The best spots for running in Shanghai are in some of the parks and along some of the promenades and pedestrian paths that have been developed. Our highlights include The Bund, the Xuhui Riverside Open Space, Century Park, and World Expo Park in Pudong. Finding a good spot to run outdoors in Shanghai can be a challenge. There is intense car and people traffic, and pollution can be an issue as well. However, there are many roads with wide sidewalks. And a great transport system makes it easy to get to a favorite spot.

Downtown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River. Remnants of the old part of the city are on the western side of the river, inside of Renmin Rd. The central financial district Lujiazui has grown up on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). The city’s topography is generally flat.

Public transport in Shanghai is a necessity and is fantastic, with metro, light rail, and buses. All of our routes are easily accessible via the Shanghai Metro System, which has 364 stations. And for those in Boston who run to beat the ‘Green Line’, try the Maglev train, which goes 268 mph!
