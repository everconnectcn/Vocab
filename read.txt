When talking about behaviour that hurt you or disappointed you in the past, it is best to take some time off to gather your thoughts before going on a rant. The thing with words is that once they’re said, you cannot undo their impact. This might be a worse situation from where you started. 
When talking to someone, make sure you use positive sentiments like making ‘I’ statements instead of ‘you’ which has an accusatory tone. Focus on solution-based conversations as well as making the other person understand why you felt a certain way--these all will help guide the conversation constructively. 
Once you’ve pointed out a mistake or an irritant, it is easy to think that that conversation is over and done with. It’s not. If you are actually committed to making the other person learn something, you must work on positive reinforcement as well. If the person is doing what you’ve told them and actually making an effort, make sure you tell them so. Appreciate it, validate it, give ‘em a shout out! How else will they know?
