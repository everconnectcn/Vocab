To Whom It May Concern,

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Zhang Wang. Zhang and I have worked collabratively at Guotai Junan Securities for over five years and I found him a creative very hardworking professional. One of the main reasons that Zhang have been successful on most of the project he is in charge is his ability to dive into details. From our local Maven repository that he set up, and the VPN server that he shared with all group members, all greatly facilitated ability to streamline our developing and deploying process in the first place. As for other projects he led, he has been always maticulous and communicative, ready to share his expertise and concerns with coworkers in evaluating the task, and dig deep into details about each feature.

During the years that I have worked with Zhang, I would describe him as a dedicated and enthusiastic individual who is ready to help others. He is never shy of asking for help and takes constructive criticism quite well. Most of the time, he is a pleasant person and give people a feeling of warmth. Please feel free to call me at (+86) 666-6666 if you would like me to further elaborate on Zhangâ€™s abilities.

Best Regard,
