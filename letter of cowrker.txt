To Whom It May Concern,

I am pleased to write this letter for Zhang Wang. Zhang and I have worked collaboratively at Guotai Junan Securities for over five years and I found him a creative, practical, forward-looking professional. One of the main reasons that Zhang have been successful on most of the project he is in charge of is his ability to plan for the future and dive into details. In the first place, from our local Maven repository that he set up, to the VPN server that he shared within our group, all greatly facilitated the streamlining of our developing and deploying process. I also remember when he dug through MySQL documents to optimize the performance of our database server, and numerous occasions that we collaborate to troubleshoot various network issues. As for other projects he is in charge of such as the search feature, he has been always meticulous, communicative and future-oriented, able to identify the main obstacles to accomplish certain tasks. He is also ready to share his expertise and experiences with coworkers and raise concerns when evaluating tasks and is able to dig deep into details about certain features.

I have quite a pleasant experience working with Zhang, I would describe him as a peaceful, enthusiastic individual who is always ready to help others. Most of the time, he is a pleasant person and gives people a feeling of warmth. Please feel free to email me at zhoulei017483@gtjas.com or call me at (+86)021-38032055 if you would like me to further elaborate on Zhangâ€™s abilities.

Best Regard,
