The bar chart shows the exports earnings of one country's exports measured in billions of dollars in various categories (Petroleum products, engineered goods, gems and gewellery, agricultural products and textiles) during 2015 and 2016, while the table shows the percentage change in each category of exports in 2016 campared with 2015.

Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that all earninngs experienced rises except for gems and jewellery, which experienced a moderate drop. The majority of earnings came from petroleum and engineered goods, while textiles and engineered goods made the largest percentile jumps.

The two major exports were petroleum products, which went from just over $61 billion i 2015 to around 63 billion by 2016, and engineered goods($58 billion to $62 billion). That translate to a 3% rise for petroleum and a more sizeable increase of 8.5% for engineered products.

Compared to these two exports, the other products were much lower. Gems and jewellery, the only export to decrease, went down 5.18% from $43 billion to $41 billion. Despite this drop, agricultural goods were lower throughout the period at around $31 and just over $31 billion in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Testiles were lowest in 2015 at round $26 billion but had pulled approximately level with agriculture by 2016.
