The demographics are one of the most important economic statics of one country.  some countries are stepping into an old age society like Japan, but also some countries have a larger population of young adults than that of the elderly. I do think that the benefit outweighs the potential drawbacks.

To start with, A larger young adults population means that a labor force is abundant. The younger generation provide the main driving force of a country. not only do they take care of the elderly and weak, but also they are the most powerful laborforce, second, young adults are the main economic driving force by consumption, numerous studies have shown that the younger generation will spend more on housing, education, leisure and other expenditure, by consumption, they make their contribution to the country's job market and make the local economy vibrant. Furthermore, young people are generally more tech-savvy and are willing to adopt new technology and management skills, thus boost the overall productivity of a country.

However, this kind of demographics does not come without downsides. For starters, the certain job will require many years of experience, when old workers retire, there would be a gap between the skilled labor force, moreover, there might not be enough experienced mentors teaching the young labor all the skills they need, putting a strain on the training program. With the above being said, I think with proper management and schedule, a nation can overcome this disadvantage.

To conclude, Even though there are potential shortcomings of the young adults' population larger than the older one, the benefit will far outweigh the downside.
