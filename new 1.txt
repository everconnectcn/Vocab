You don’t have to be a studio musician to be in a rock band, you don’t have to spend a fortune on equipment. Starting a band with friends who likes music as much as you do can be a way to have fun, be creative, and good for meeting new people.
To start off, you’ll need a few things. Some basic musical equipment. First, purchase a guitar. It can be either acoustic or electric, it doesn’t really matter. Each of the guitar players need to know the basic chords is G, C, and D or A, E, and D. Learn these basic chords and a whole world of rock music will open up to you. If you buy an electric guitar; you’ll also need an amp. Purchasing at least one microphone is also a good idea that includes a stand. 
Next, you have to recruit the band members. A trio is a good number. A guitar player, drummer, and someone who plays the bass are what you’ll need to start. Decide on a place to practise. When practising, the music’s volume might affect the choice of location. Everyone should ask their parents. If one of your bandmates have 
understanding parents, garages or basements are great places to practise. 
Before the band can really get up and running; you’ll need to create a song list. Five songs is a good number to start. The internet is a good place to look for lyrics and chords.There’s also good websites to find many different songs. You can also listen to your favourite songs on your stereo and pick out the chords yourself. A great way to train your ear. When you feel more comfortable, try to write your own music and lyrics with your 
guitar.
Time to practise. Have band members review the songs on their own before you rehearse as a group. 
Don’t forget that you’ll need a name for your band. It should be a name that stands out but one that’s not too weird. It should be simple, catchy, and one that makes people take notice.
