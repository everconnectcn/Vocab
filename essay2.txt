How can you do paraphrasing?
There are different methods of paraphrasing sentences:

1. Use Synonyms
One of the effective ways of paraphrasing is to replace some words in the sentence with synonyms. For example,
Crime needs to be controlled as it affects development of a city.

It is necessary to control violence in the city as it hampers its growth.

2. Change Active to Passive Voice
Changing the voice of sentence from active to passive is another good method of paraphrasing a sentence. For example,
Government should implement the changes in policies as quickly as possible.

The changes in policies should be implemented by the government as soon as possible.

3. Change order of words/phrases

The simplest way of paraphrasing is to change the order of words in a sentence. For example,

In the society, there has been a drastic change in the status of women for the last few years.
