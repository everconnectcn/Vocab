High levels of sugar in our diet are causing quite many health problems such as diabetes and obesity. People are suggesting that sugary products should be made more expensive to discourage consumers eat sugar. I do not agree with this idea and will give my suggestions.

Certainly, sugary foods and drinks are causing some health problems, but they are offering an affordable alternative to people in poor economic conditions. Various studies have shown that healthy, sugar-free produces will be likely costing more than double what a normal sugar-contain burger would cost.  Low-income families can only afford those sugary produces, and they simply could not survive if the more affordable products were made more expensive.

Also, the suggestion of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened food does not make too much sense in terms of forcing people to choose other food. A majority of fruit and vegetables contain a certain kind of sugar, and also many countries deem rice and wheat flour as their staple food, which contains a high amount of sugar. Raising the price of sugary food will be a huge disruption of what these countries consume, And it will not achieve the pre-planned goal of letting people choose non-sugary food, because nearly all the food available contains sugar.

To address this issue, awareness should be raised about the negative effect of excessive sugar on human health and the importance of a balanced diet. Also, the government can try to encourage farmers to grow more vegetables and thus give more supply of healthy food and maybe lower the healthy food price.

In summary, I think increasing the price of sugary food is not the right approach to tackle people's health problems, but rather a healthy eating habit should be made aware to the public, and governmental intervention on the supply side of healthy food might help.
