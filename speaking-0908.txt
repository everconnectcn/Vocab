okay actually when I'm a child I live in this village where you know it has less than 500 people and there's only one school which located in the south or the village and it's just a sit right at the riverbank and  actually everyone in my village go to this school including my parents and their parents. so it it's just a really common and normal school and I remember that there's a quite flower garden like a quite large flower garden there and it was beautiful and during the springtime all the flowers are going to flourish and blossoms great and there's a lot of trays in the school and allowed to you know play with my kids under the tree sometimes when the ones is blowing it russells and it's really a feeling of being with the nature and I remember that all the you know the hardware the the facilities is quite shabby and rundown and we don't even have a a sports with a spot facility but later on when I was in six a great I think the principal decided to set up some spot facilities like ping-pong table so that people 

okay I think there's quite a famous show called America got talent I love this show quite a lot so actually I I don't know when I discovered this show but when I'm wondering on YouTube someday I came across this show and I started so so talented and Ijust can't keep myself not watching it so this show is actually you know they have four hosts and I think the host will decide whether this performers will continue or not. so it's quite a some basics stuff I mean the rules are very simple. so it's mostly about the performers and all of them are quite talented there are like little boys and there are like old people in in their 90s or 80s and there are also all kinds of talents they perform whether it's sing a song which is very hard to sing or their magicians they perform those done stunts which is very horrifying to watch like sometimes they cut themselves to in half and later on they will rescue themselves to you know a whole and there are also people who you know perform those really talented dance and I think there's one performers that I remember really vividly I think she's a little girl and she plays with his plays with her doll skip 

I think the city I'm going to say is Shanghai which located in East China and I think it's one of the most largest city in the world and the first time when I visited I think it's because when I was when I want to find job or when I was still at school I want to be found a intern job at the city so I came here and right now I'm leaving and working here so so why do I like it the reason I think it's because it's a quite mmm vibrant city and it's quite cousin party cut politics it's quite international so you can do a lot of activities there, there are all kinds of bars a coffee house and a lot of foreigners if you are interested in like foreign culture you don't even to step out of your city to you know talk to a foreigner to exchange some opinions ideas about things and stuff. and also why I was another reading that the food and architecture. I mean you can see all kinds of high-rise buildings guide great skyscrapers rising about the city skyline and this quite a glamorous city and the specific thing that I really like is that I can write along a cycling path just beside the river and it's quite a scenic path and with the trees arching over
