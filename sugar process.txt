The diagram shows how sugar is made from sugar cane using modern technology and manufacturing process.

The first stage mainly happens on the sugar cane field and mainly comprise the grow of sugar cane. The whole process begins with sugar cane being growed in the field for 12-18 months, before they are harvested either by machinary or by manual labor.  

The second stage mainly focus on processes that happened in factories and is about turning sugar canes into the sugar we eat. After being harvested, The  sugar canes are crushed to juice by a machine and then the raw juice are  purified using a limestone filter. An evaporator is used to heat the purified juice and then it densifies and becomes syrup. After this evaporating process, the syrup is then put into a centrifuge and sugar crystals will be separated in this process. At the final stage, the sugar crystals are  dried and cooled, forming the sugar that we consume.
