Whether to settle with a bad situation in our life or try to counteract this situation that happened to us, is a philosophical question. Although accepting this situation might help us to find inner peace or benefit in short term, I do think we should try our best to improve ourselves to disposes of the situation or to alleviate it. This essay will discuss the benefit and disadvantages of accepting a bad situation and give my opinion that we should try our best to alleviate this situation.

Accepting an unsatisfying situation could be beneficial on some occasions. Rather than fight with the current situation, accepting it could give people a footstep. For example, for prisoners in China, they might find the living condition dare and their basic human rights being violated, but if they dare to oppose it or voice it, they might be targeted even more by the prison guard, resulting them being physically beaten. So rather than oppose a situation they can not decide, they can try their best to accept the situation and find their inner peace, read some books. In this way, they can avoid being physically abused and have a relatively healthy mental and physical state, which can do them good when they served their period.

Rather than accepting the situation passively, proactively try to change the situation might do the greater good. For example, Bill Gates and his Clean Toilet Program which trying to solve the sanitation problem of Africa is doing a great job. By reducing the cost of building and maintaining the human waste treating facilities, this program has successfully changed the unclean situation which affects the health of local people.

In summary, it is acceptable to accept an unsatisfying situation, but if people can try taking a proactive approach and alleviate the situation, this can be beneficial to the greater good.
